It is a dynamic Power BI dashboard that tracks key metrics—Sales, Profit, and Quantity—across four regions: Central, East, South, and West. The dashboard should allow users to filter by year and dynamically switch between the three metrics (Sales, Profit, and Quantity). Additionally, it should include a comparison with the previous year's (PY) sales for the selected year.
